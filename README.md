# Overview
An umbrella project for easily compiling all my projects related to C language parsing.

It includes:

* [CParser](https://github.com/programmatix/CParser): turns valid C code into a nice clean abstract syntax tree (AST) to be used in your JVM project.  Written in Scala.
* [CParserWebDemo](https://github.com/programmatix/CParserWebDemo): turns CParser into a Javascript widget (it's in Scala, but transpiles to JS with ScalaJS) that you can embed in a website.  It can display the AST, or turn the original C back into C again, which isn't very useful but does act as a simple example of how to walk the AST generated by CParser.
